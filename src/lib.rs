//! # Deencode: Reverse engineer encoding errors
//!
//! The goal of this crate is to automatically explore the result of
//! successively encoding then decoding a string using different encoding
//! schemes, which usually results in some corruption of the non-ASCII
//! characters.
//!
//! ## Concepts
//!
//! * [Engines](engine/trait.Engine.html) are objects that represent an encoding
//!   scheme, and can be used to encode (String to bytes) or decode (bytes to
//!   String). A number of engines are already implemented into this crate, with
//!   static instances if you want to use them.
//! * The structure of deencoding is a
//!   [tree](deencodetree/struct.DeencodeTree.html): from an input string, every
//!   engine may give an encoding, then every engine gives a decoding of that
//!   encoding, and so on.
//!
//! > _Note_: The deencoding process is not optimised to avoid doing the same
//! > steps over and over. It is recommended to keep the depth to small numbers.
//! > Deduplication can then be applied to remove duplication in the tree.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use deencode::*;
//!
//! // List the engines to use.
//! let engines: Vec<&dyn Engine> = vec![&UTF8, &LATIN1, &MIXED816BE, &MIXED816LE, &UTF7];
//! // Explore the tree of possible encodings and decodings.
//! let mut tree = deencode("ClÃ©ment", &engines, 1);
//! // Remove duplicate entries from the tree.
//! let _ = tree.deduplicate();
//!
//! // Export the tree with box drawings.
//! println!("{}", tree);
//! // Export the tree as JSON.
//! println!("{}", serde_json::to_string(&tree).unwrap());
//! ```
